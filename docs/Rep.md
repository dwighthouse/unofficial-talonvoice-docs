# Rep

Constructor for function that, when invoked, repeats the last [Action](Actions.md). That could include an [Action](Actions.md), a Data Entry task, or even a previous repetition [Action](Actions.md).


## Usage

> **Rep(repeat_count)**
>
> repeat_count - Integer indicating the number of times to repeat the previous [Action](Actions.md)
>
> *Returns* - Result of the execution of Rep, which is needed by Talon to prevent infinite recursion

The Rep function constructor takes a number argument indicating how many times to repeat the previous [Action](Actions.md) or task.

Like [Key](Key.md), Rep can be used in response to a spoken [Command](Commands.md), or called directly in a custom function. However, when called directly, it must be carefully constructed as described below.


## Obtain

```python
from talon.voice import Rep
```


## Examples

These examples are used within a [Context](Context.md), either defined with a keymap, or called directly from a function.

### Within a Context's keymap

```python
context.keymap({
    'twice': Rep(1),
})
```

When saying `🔊 twice`, whatever happened immediately before will be repeated once. For example, saying `🔊 phrase hello world twice` would result in "hello worldhello world" being printed because the first part (`🔊 phrase hello world`) enters "hello world", and the second part (`🔊 twice`) enters it again.

> **Warning:** The number argument passed to Rep is one less than the number of output values, not equal to it. Rep cannot retroactively remove the result of the previous [Action](Actions.md), so this off-by-one must be taken into account.

### Called directly in a function

This example function does the same thing as the previous example, but using a direct call.

```python
def repeat_twice(m):
    from talon.voice import talon

    repeater = Rep(1)
    repeater.ctx = talon
    return repeater(None)

context.keymap({
    'twice': repeat_twice,
})
```

> **Warning:** The constructed Rep function, `repeater` in this case, must have its `ctx` attribute set to `talon`, which is imported from `talon.voice`. Additionally, the result of calling `repeater` must be returned. Failing to do either will result in a Talon error.

A general-purpose repetition [Command](Commands.md) can be built by parsing numbers in a [Command](Commands.md), then using the detected integer as input to the Rep constructor. An implementation of this is [repeater.py](https://github.com/dwighthouse/talonvoice-scripts/blob/master/repeater.py).
