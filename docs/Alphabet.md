# Alphabet

Talon, like most speech-to-text programs, can't tell the difference between homophones. It can't tell the difference between `ğŸ”Š there`, `ğŸ”Š their`, and `ğŸ”Š they're`, for example. The problem is similar for the pronounciation of letters, such as how `ğŸ”Š tea` and `ğŸ”Š T` sound the same. Furthermore, entering an individual letter is a not a normal occurance in a standard dictation scenario that is expecting sentences, as Dragon does.

To solve this, Talon uses special keywords that will be interpreted as individual letters when spoken. Memorizing these letter-words is very important to successfully programming or operating a computer by voice, since letters often make up part of keyboard shortcuts, and they can be used to spell out words that Dragon or Talon do not know or can't recognize.

At the time of writing, the standard alphabet letter-words is as follows. Most other [Rules](Rules.md) can be learned through repetition and their association with their Voice Command's meaning. These words, however, were chosen to ensure a unique sound to allow for easier and more accurate detection.
